# Metro-App
This C++ program is designed to provide users with information about the shortest route and least time between two Delhi Metro stations. It leverages graph and heap data structures to model the metro network, where nodes represent metro stations and include details such as the station’s name, the metro corridor it belongs to, and the lines it connects. Edges in the graph represent the connections between stations, with the weight of each edge corresponding to the distance between the two connected stations. Users input the names of the source and destination stations, and the program calculates and displays the time, the distance, and the shortest metro route. The program employs algorithms like Dijkstra’s, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS) to determine the shortest path. Additionally, a metro map is provided to aid commuters in navigating the network more effectively.# Metro-App
